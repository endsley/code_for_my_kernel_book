# Introduction

Machine Learning is a topic that requires a significant amount of background knowledge to tackle. To even begin studying the topic, a beginner student often needs to have already mastered multivariate calculus, linear algebra, statistics, programming, and basic machine learning techniques. Within the various branches of Machine Learning, Kernel Methods are particularly difficult for beginners.&#x20;

From my personal experience, this is because the majority of the kernel literature is written by experienced experts. Therefore, much of the underlying background knowledge necessary to understand this literature is rarely explained. Moreover, the prerequisite background is significant; it would be impractical to include it in each publication. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of material that is specifically aimed at helping beginners transition into the kernel literature. It consequently results in a high barrier of entry for beginners to enter the kernel domain in the first place.&#x20;

The purpose of this book is twofold. First, I hope to bridge the gap for the beginner Ph.D. student by providing the necessary background to gain an intuitive understanding of kernels. Therefore, the style of writing for this book will differ vastly from traditional machine learning conference papers and journals. Since most conference papers have a strict page limit, if the reader doesn't understand the algorithm based on their description, they are stuck. In contrast, this book does not have a page limit. Therefore, we are free to describe the same algorithms in multiple ways from various different perspectives. In many cases, the most difficult portion is to understand the derivations of various algorithms. This is often because the current literature, due to page limits,  is forced to jump steps that may confuse many beginners. The purpose of this writing is to purposely slow down the derivation and attempt to walk through them slowly.&#x20;

Moreover, we are able to provide extra examples to further supplement our descriptions. While for some audiences, this appears redundant, we argue that the objective of this work is not aimed to maximize the conciseness of the language. The objective of this writing is to enable the maximum amount of people to understand kernels. While this book still assumes a basic understanding the fundamental mathematics, we hope to simplify the process of understanding kernels. Once a basic understanding is reached, our second goal is to present many modern methods of how kernels can be used for various applications.&#x20;

For more beginner students, it is very important that you read the book in sequence and only move on once you have mastered the basic concepts. This is because the book is designed to build on top of previous ideas continuously. Therefore, without mastering the previous chapters, it would be rather difficult to move on.&#x20;

For more advanced students, it is also important to know the required material. To make this easier, at the beginning of each section, we purposely add a **Prerequisite** section that links to the necessary background material. This would allow the student to quickly go back and refresh the key ideas that were forgotten.&#x20;
