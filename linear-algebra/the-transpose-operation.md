## The Transpose

Given a matrix

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 &5\\ 3 & 4 & 3 \end{bmatrix},
$$

we denote the transpose of the matrix $$\mathbf{Y}$$ as $$\mathbf{Y}^\top$$, where the transpose is equivalent to&#x20;

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 \\ 5&  3 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

Notice that the transpose is the mirror image of the original matrix along the 45 degree angle.&#x20;
